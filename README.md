# Installation

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.
You can get them both bundled together with the [nodejs installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) for windows or mac for free.

After cloning the repository, open a command line, go to directory you cloned the repository to and run `npm install`.

# Build & watch

During development use `npm run watch` (once) to build the project and start watching for changes.

`npm run serve` will start a local webserver on `http://localhost:8085` so that you can preview your changes.

# Tasks

You are now ready to work on your tasks. To make things easier for you, we have prepared:

- Scaffolding
- LESS variables you can re-use (`/src/styles/global/`)
- Boilerplate package for the article component (`src/node_modules/component~article`)
